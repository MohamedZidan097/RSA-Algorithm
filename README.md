# RSA-Algorithm
* Using RSA with 1024-bit primes p and q and a public exponent e = 65537, encrypt the message m = 466921883457309. 
* Use the Tradational decryption
* Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decrypt the resulting ciphertext c.
* compute how long it takes compared to decryption without using CRT (show the timing results).
